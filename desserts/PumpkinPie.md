# Pumpkin Pie

The most traditional pie for Thanksgiving in the US.
I started preparing this pie for each Thanksgiving for the last 16 years, because my kids love it.
After reading about the filling somewhere in the web, I came up with my version which I detail here.

The base comes from a French cook book. It is the recipy of the "Pate brisee" from the "Tartes et Patisseries" of the "Le Cordon Blue" series. For this kind of things, I trust the French.

## The base

** Ingredients **

- 200 g  Flour
- bit of Salt
- 70 g   Sweet butter
- 80 g   Sugar
- 1      Egg, slightly beaten
- 1-2 drops of vanilla extact

** Procedure **

1. In a bowl put flour, sugar, salt, and butter in small cubes

2. Mix them together until they form a dough. I use a tool to mix them which enormously simplify the task. Towards the end, add the drops of vanilla extract.

3. Take the dough out the bowl and work on a floured surface with the palm of your hand until it become smooth.

4. Put the dough together in a ball and flatten it slightly. Cover with a plastic film and put it in the refrigerator for approximately 20 minutes before using it.

## The filling

** Ingredients **

- Puree of a sugar pumpkin

- 200 g of Sugar

- 3  Eggs

-  1 can (12oz) of evaporated milk

- 1.5 tsp of cinammon

- 1   tsp of ground clove

- 0.5 tsp of ground ginger

- 1   tsp of nutmeg

** Procedure **

1. Cut the pumpkin, clean it from the seeds, and steam it for 30 minutes

2. Peel the pieces and blend them to obtain a pulp of pumpkin.

3. Once the pulp is cold, pour into the sugar and the spicies. Mix thoroughly.

4. Add one egg at the time and mix.

5. Finally add the evaporated milk.

6. At this point, when the oven reaches the 210 C, pour the filling into the prepared bases.

7. Leave in the oven for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 175C and leave for another 45-60 minutes.
Check if they are cooked well with a toothpick. If the toothpick comes out clean, it is time to take them out of the oven.

8. Once out of the oven, wait 2-3 minutes to cool down and detach from the pan walls. The take the pies off and let them cool on a rack for at least 2 hours.

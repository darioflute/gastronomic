# Pumpkin Pie

The most traditional pie for Thanksgiving in the US.
I started preparing this pie for each Thanksgiving for the last 16 years, because my kids love it.
After reading about the filling somewhere in the web, I came up with my version which I detail here.

The base comes from a French cook book. It is the recipy of the "Pate brisee" from the "Tartes et Patisseries" of the "Le Cordon Blue" series. For this kind of things, I trust the French.

1. Work butter and sugar together reducing them to a cream.
2. Add one egg at the time and mix it in.
3. Add salt and flower, a bit at the time, and 50ml of milk to keep the batter fluid.
4. Pour 2/3 of the batter in the pan.
6. Add cocoa and 25ml of milk to the remaining 1/3 of the batter and mix throughly. Pour it in the pan. Then, with a fork, gently mix doing spirals from the bottom to the top to create a pattern of dark filaments in the final cake.
7. Bake at 175C for approximately 55 minutes.
